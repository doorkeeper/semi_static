# SemiStatic: A simple text-file based CMS for Rails

In our internal projects, such as [請求書.jp](https://www.seikyusho.jp/) and [Doorkeeper](http://www.doorkeeper.jp/), we have had the need to generate lots of text content, such as news entries or FAQ pages. SemiStatic provides you with an easy way to manage such content.
